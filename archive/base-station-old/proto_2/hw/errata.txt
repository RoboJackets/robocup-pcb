Pads for TXD/RXD
5V regulator needs to accept 6-15V input
D6 should take 5V, not 9V (3.3V reg's input only tolerates 6V).
Crystal footprint/availability
Pulldown on UVCON
Didn't connect /CS on radio
Swap C146 and C145 positions.
Capacitor placement/routing according to radio reference design.
Increase clearance on SMT pads in ground plane to remove slivers.
Clearance too small on one track.
Wrong pinout on radio crystal (need ground pins too)
Connect vbus_in to a GPIO
Switcher for 5V?

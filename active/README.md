===========
This is where you will find the current progress for the design files of the 2014-2015 electrical system revisions. Listed below are links to informative sources regarding design progress.

* Detailed tracking of most electrical subtasks are found on the [RoboJackets Wiki](http://wiki.robojackets.org/w/RoboCup:_Redesign_2014-2015).
* Data captures of the 2011 robot's electrical systems can be found in the [`/firmware/robot2011/cpu/data`](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/tree/master/firmware/robot2011/cpu/data) directory of the [robocup-software](https://github.com/robojackets/robocup-software) repository.
  * Python scripts for data analysis are found in [`/firmware/robot2011/cpu/tools`](https://github.com/RoboJackets/robocup-software/tree/master/firmware/robot2011/cpu/tools).

# Radio Board 2015

The 2015 radio has an mbed as the main processor and two radio boards.  We currently only use one of them, but in the future we'd like to support more than six robots at a time.  Two radio boards should give us capacity to communicate with 12 if we implement it in software.

The board also has a mini usb connector, which is used in normal operation.  The mbed's usb port is only needed for flashing new firmware or debugging.  You can use the two usb ports simultaneously.

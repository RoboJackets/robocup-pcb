# Kicker Board
On Robot Board 

## Objective 
Board responsible for kicking and chipping functions of bot.

## Details
- Very high power board, as a lot of power is needed for charging the solenoid.  
- Has discharge lines for both kicking and chipping functions, two types of passes for the bot.  
- Due to the high power, board setup is designed to protect against voltage spikes, surges and other irregularities.  
- A microcontroller is present to handle both manual inputs and control board inputs governing functionality.  
- This board interfaces with the breakbeam board to determine if the bot is in possession of the ball.  
- Has LEDs to determine if the board is functioning properly, as well as manual switches to test certain functions.

# Finalize Board

When board completely done and ready to order ensure the following are completed:
* Board folder named "board-name"-v"version"
* Export board to PNG and place in folder
* Create README.md with description of the board and PNG of the board
* Create gerber.zip file of all Gerber files to be sent to board fab
* After all items added for board, make final commit for board version and tag commit as "board-name"-v"version"
* Once pushed to Github create release of board from tag consisting of list of changes from past version, link to gerber.zip (Github raw link for that tag), and PNG of board
    * For prototypes mark release as pre-release

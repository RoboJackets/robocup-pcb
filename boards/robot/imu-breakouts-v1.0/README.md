# Breakout Boards
On Robot Boards 

# Objective 
Breakout boards allow for easy interfacing with various IC. These ICs are IMU IC, or Inertial Measurement Unit. IMUs measure the accelerations of the robot, which is imoprtant for motion control.

# Details 
ICM42605: Accelerometer and Gyroscope IC  <br />
LSM9DS1: Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer IC, has both linear and angular accelerometer components <br />
MPU-925: 9 Axis Gyroscope, Accelerometer and Compass  <br />
ICM-20948:9 Axis Gyroscope, Accelerometer and Compass. This component also requires level shifting for the SPI inputs (voltage level change)

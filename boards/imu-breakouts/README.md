# Breakout Boards

## Breakout boards allow for easy interfacing with various IC. These IC are IMU IC, or Inertial Measurement Unit
ICM42605: An Accelerometer and Gyroscope IC;\n 
LSM9DS1: An Accelerometer, Gyroscope and Magnetometer IC, has both linear and angular accelerometer components; \n
MPU-9250, 9 Axis: Gyroscope, Accelerometer and Compass; \n
ICM-20948: another 9 Axis Gyroscope, Accelerometer and Compass. This component also requires level shifting for the SPI inputs (voltage level change)
